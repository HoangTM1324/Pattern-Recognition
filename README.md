## Abstract:
Yolov12 is a newly introduced model that incorporates attention mechanisms into its architecture, leveraging their strengths to achieve high processing speed and accuracy. While the model demonstrates impressive performance on datasets such as MS COCO 2017—which features multiple classes and typically large-sized target objects—the task addressed in this study presents a contrasting scenario: detecting human heads with only a single class. This task involves detecting small, densely packed human heads under heavy occlusion, which poses significant challenges for spatial localization and model robustness. Given the stark differences in data characteristics, this research focuses on analyzing the attention mechanisms within Yolov12, particularly examining how the kernel size and padding of the convolutional block used in position perciever affects model performance when applied to the crowd detection task on the CrowdHuman dataset. We explore the trade-offs between spatial precision and computational overhead introduced by different configurations of the position perciever module. The results indicate that the modified version of the model achieves faster training times compared to the original Yolov12, while still maintaining comparable accuracy across evaluation metrics such as AP (Average Precision), AR (Average Recall) and mAP (mean Average Precision). Furthermore, qualitative results suggest similar localization performance in heavily occluded scenarios, highlighting the benefits of tailoring architectural components to the nature of the detection task. This study contributes valuable insights into how Yolov12 can be effectively optimized for specialized object detection applications beyond general-purpose datasets. Our findings encourage further research into attention-driven design adaptations for detecting small-scale and densely located targets, offering practical implications for surveillance, crowd analysis, and other real-world applications where accuracy and efficiency are equally critical.
